Comparison of Multivariate Gaussian transformations
---------------------------------------------------

Example code for presenting the comparison of MVN using: sampling, linearization (like EKF) and unscented transformation (like UKF).

The code simplifies the testing for different conditions and provides a 2x3 plot with x and y over 2D. 
Metrics for comparing the resulting gaussians are also provided
